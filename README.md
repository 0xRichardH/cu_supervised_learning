- twitter_bot_detection_v1.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project, is using Logistic Regression Classifier to classify Twitter accounts as bots or not bots.
- twitter_bot_detection_v2.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project, is using Support Vector Machine Classifier to classify Twitter accounts as bots or not bots.
  - The key difference between v1 and v2 is that v2 uses different feature selection techniques.
